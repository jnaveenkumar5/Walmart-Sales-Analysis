## üí∞ Revenue & Profit Calculations  

### Key Financial Formulas  

- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**  
  $$ COGS = \text{unit price} \times \text{quantity} $$

- **VAT Calculation (5% of COGS)**  
  $$ VAT = 0.05 \times COGS $$

- **Total Revenue (Gross Sales)**  
  $$ \text{Total} = VAT + COGS $$

- **Gross Profit Calculation**  
  $$ \text{Gross Profit} = \text{Total} - COGS $$

- **Gross Margin Percentage**  
  $$ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{\text{Gross Income}}{\text{Total Revenue}} $$

### Example Calculation (First Row in Dataset)  

#### Given Data:
- **Unit Price** = $45.79$  
- **Quantity** = $7$  

#### Calculation:

1. **COGS Calculation**  
   $$ COGS = 45.79 \times 7 = 320.53 $$  

2. **VAT Calculation**  
   $$ VAT = 5\% \times 320.53 = 16.0265 $$  

3. **Total Revenue Calculation**  
   $$ \text{Total} = 320.53 + 16.0265 = 336.5565 $$  

4. **Gross Margin Percentage Calculation**  
   $$ \text{Gross Margin} = \frac{16.0265}{336.5565} \approx 0.0476 \text{ (4.76%)} $$
